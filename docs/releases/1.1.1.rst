1.1.1 Aster
============

This is the first patch release in the Aster 1.1 series.

Notable changes
----------------

* Fix burrito.sh script to support offline environment.
  It did not include offline_vars.yml so it always tried to get images from
  the internet and failed. 
* Support online-only installation. It used to use the local registry 
  even if it is online-installation. 
  Now the local registry is not needed for online installation. 
  Updated README.rst for this change.
